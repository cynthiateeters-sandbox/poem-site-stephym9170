        <h2>The Poem</h2>
        <p>
          sleepwalking through her life, <br />
          I wrap her up <br />
          and we go through the snow that fell all night <br />
          and all through this Christmas morning: her trainers barely denting
          the whitened lawn, her <br />
          two strides for every stride of mine. Leaving her home <br />
          to the warmth of the house <br />
          I step back out, and see where my footprints turn <br />
          and walk through hers, <br />
          the other way—following the trail <br />
          of rabbit and deer into the unreachable silences of snow. <br />
          I can bring nothing of this back intact. <br />
          My face is smoke, my body water, <br />
          my tracks are made of snow. The next morning is a dripping thaw, and
          winter <br />
          is gone from the grass—except for a line <br />
          of white marks going nowhere: <br />
          the stamped ellipses of impacted snow; <br />
          everything gone, leaving just this, this ghost-tread, <br />
          these wafer-thin footsteps of glass.
